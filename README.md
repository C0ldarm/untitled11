Line 8: Variable name humanIMB matches class name; rename to person or similar for clarity.  

Line 13: W and H are unclear; use weight and height instead.  

Line 15: imb is static, should be instance-specific; remove static.  

Line 19: No check for H == 0 in imb calculation; add validation.  

Line 27: putW lacks validation for negative w; check w >= 0.  

Line 32: putH lacks validation for h <= 0; check h > 0.  

Line 36: takeImt name unclear, should be getImb; static conflicts with non-static imb.

Line 40: Use && instead of & for logical AND.  

Line 42: Same as above; replace & with &&.  

Line 44: No upper bound for imb >= 30; consider adding a comment.
